# Portfolio-Management
This is a group project. I worked on portfolio-C of the project. Summerized report of portfolio is given below:

• Construct a portfolio containing three assets, including one short position in financial instruments.

• Studied past year data of HCL Technology stocks, Binance Coin cryptocurrency, and Vanguard
Growth ETF in order to find the rate of return and volatility.

• Correlations between the stocks, cryptocurrency and ETF give diversification to the portfolio and help
us to reduce portfolio variation
